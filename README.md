> **Community fork — Simplified Chinese interface.**
>
> Upstream [`Devin-Marks/pi-forge`](https://github.com/Devin-Marks/pi-forge) was
> **archived on 2026-09-16**, so it is read-only and no longer maintained. This fork is
> based on the final upstream release **`v1.5.4`** and adds a source-level i18n layer with
> `en` and `zh-CN` locales plus a language picker. Upstream's MIT copyright and license
> text are retained verbatim in [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE).
>
> **The change is almost entirely client-side.** All the i18n code lives in
> `packages/client/src/i18n/` plus 42 client files. A handful of server files differ, and
> only in **display strings**: the CLI command name, the startup log line, the OpenAPI
> title and the OTEL `service.name` default. Server behaviour, routes, SSE events, the
> data format, every `FORGE_*`/`PI_CONFIG_DIR` env var, every CLI flag, the JWT audience
> and the `pi-forge/*` browser storage keys are untouched from upstream `v1.5.4`.
>
> - Chinese UI: open <http://localhost:3000/?lang=zh-CN>, or just use a Chinese browser
> - English UI is unchanged: `en` is the reference locale and the runtime falls back to it
> - Docs: [`packages/client/src/i18n/README.md`](./packages/client/src/i18n/README.md)
>   (the i18n contract), [`docs/fork/`](./docs/fork/README.md) (fork maintenance), [`docs/fork/UPGRADE.md`](./docs/fork/UPGRADE.md) (how this fork tracks a
>   new upstream/SDK release), [`docs/fork/VERIFY.md`](./docs/fork/VERIFY.md) (how it is verified)

A self-hosted browser UI for the [pi coding agent](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi).
Chat with the agent against your code, browse files, run a terminal, and review
diffs — all from one tab.

## Why pi-forge?

- **Self-hosted, single-tenant.** Your code, your provider keys, your container.
  No cloud, no analytics, no multi-tenant cross-talk.
- **Container-native.** Ships as a Docker image; deploys to Docker Compose,
  Kubernetes, or OpenShift with the manifests in this repo. Bind-mount your
  project tree, set an API key, go.
- **Same API the UI uses.** Every browser interaction is a REST or SSE call
  documented at `/api/docs`. Scripts, CI pipelines, and the chat UI hit the
  same endpoints — no shadow surface.

## Quick start

### Docker (recommended for ongoing use)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jisi71/pi-forge-zh.git
cd pi-forge-zh
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env       # edit auth + paths if you want
cd docker && docker compose up -d --build
```

### Rootless Podman (SELinux-enabled Linux)

Use the Podman overlay so the container user maps to your host user and Podman
can apply private SELinux labels to the three bind mounts:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jisi71/pi-forge-zh.git
cd pi-forge-zh
cp docker/.env.example docker/.env       # edit auth + paths if you want
cd docker
PUID=$(id -u) PGID=$(id -g) \
  podman-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.podman.yml up -d --build
```

Do not disable SELinux. The `:Z` mount labels are private to this container;
use a different host directory if another container must mount the same path.

### npm (no Docker, runs from your shell)

```bash
npx pi-forge                  # one-shot
npm install -g pi-forge       # or install globally, then `pi-forge`
```

By default pi-forge listens on `http://localhost:3000`, reads provider config
from `~/.pi/agent/` (shared with the host `pi` CLI if you have one), and
stores its own state in `~/.pi-forge/`. Override with flags or env vars —
every server env var has a matching `--flag`:

```bash
pi-forge --port 4000 --workspace-path ~/Code
pi-forge --api-key @/run/secrets/api-key --no-expose-docs
pi-forge --help            # full flag table grouped by category
```

Flags win when both a flag and the matching env var are set. See
[`docs/configuration.md`](./docs/configuration.md) for the full mapping.

Open the listed URL, add a project (a folder under your workspace path),
drop a provider API key into Settings, and start a session.

For source builds and a development setup see
[`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md); for everything else follow the
[Documentation](#documentation) table below.

## Features

- **Streaming chat** — token-by-token rendering with inline tool calls and results.
- **Branchable session tree** — fork at any prior turn, navigate the tree,
  bookmark abandoned branches, summarize-on-navigate.
- **Per-turn diff panel** — every file the agent touched in the last turn,
  aggregated into one reviewable changeset.
- **Workspace tools in one tab** — file browser, tabbed CodeMirror editor with
  ripgrep search, integrated `node-pty` terminal (persists across page refresh),
  and a full git panel (status, diff, stage, commit, push, branch, log).
- **MCP integration** — connect remote servers (StreamableHTTP / SSE) AND
  local stdio servers; per-project `.mcp.json` with a per-project trust
  gate on stdio (you opt in once per project), per-tool toggles, master
  kill-switch in Settings.
- **Pi-subagents support** — built-in surfacing of the community
  [pi-subagents](https://github.com/nicobailon/pi-subagents) plugin (install
  separately): rich tool card for parent calls, child sessions in the project
  sidebar with cascade-delete on parent removal.
- **Session orchestration** — opt-in supervisor mode for a session
  (available by default; toggle per-session): adds an
  `orchestrate_*` tool group so the agent can spawn, observe, message,
  interrupt, and kill worker sessions in the same project. Worker
  events stream back into the supervisor's inbox; the supervisor's
  LLM wakes on activity and reacts.
- **Optional tool sandbox** — opt-in deployment mode that runs agent/user
  shell surfaces as a restricted UID/GID, scopes model file tools, and
  keeps server-side config, forge data, and mounted secrets out of that
  identity when mounts are permissioned for the split.
- **Webhooks** — HTTPS POST deliveries on agent and session events
  (`agent_end`, `ask_user_question`, `process_alert`, `auto_retry_end`,
  `compaction_end`, `session_created`, `session_deleted`). Global or
  per-project scope, optional HMAC-SHA256 signing, custom headers (Bearer
  tokens etc., redacted on the wire), delivery history with retries.
- **Background-process tool** — the `process` tool lets the agent
  spawn long-running processes (dev servers, watchers, builds) that
  outlive a single turn. Per-session manager, log capture, regex
  watches, alerts on exit.
- **Browser-native `todo` + `ask_user_question` tools** — drop-in
  contract-compatible implementations of the community plugins; live
  panel in the chat surface, per-session state.
- **Quick actions** — operator-defined chips in the chat toolbar
  that either run a shell command in the active project's cwd or
  insert/send a templated prompt to the active session.
- **Skill and extension slash commands** — discover enabled skills and
  registered local or external extension commands from the chat input's `/`
  palette. Skills use the validated skill flow; extensions use their registered
  prompt handlers and can leave dismissible Markdown feedback in the timeline.
- **Provider management** — Anthropic / OpenAI / Google / OpenRouter built-in,
  plus custom OpenAI-compatible endpoints (vLLM, LiteLLM, Ollama, internal
  gateways) via `models.json`.
- **Per-project overrides** — tri-state toggles (enable / disable / inherit)
  for skills, tools, and prompts; cascade view shows every project's override
  at a glance.
- **Auth that fits ops** — browser password + JWT (auto-generated signing key,
  persisted across restarts) and / or a static API key for scripts and CI.
  Loopback bind by default.
- **Programmatic API** — REST + SSE with auto-generated OpenAPI 3 spec at
  `/api/docs/json` and an interactive Swagger UI at `/api/docs`.
- **Installable PWA** — manifest with raster + maskable icons, offline page,
  mobile-tuned chat surface, "Add to Home Screen" on desktop and mobile.

## Versions

Each pi-forge release pins exact patch versions of the pi SDK trio
(`pi-coding-agent`, `pi-agent-core`, `pi-ai`) — no caret/tilde — so a
transparent SDK upgrade can't surprise an existing install. Pinned versions
live in [`packages/server/package.json`](./packages/server/package.json).

Only the latest tag is supported. Breaking SDK changes pi-forge had to absorb
appear in the release notes' **Changed** section. Per-tag notes:
[CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).

## Heads up

pi-forge drives a coding agent that runs real commands (`bash`, `write`,
`edit`) as the container user. Review what it does, set provider-side spending
limits, and run it on a private network — pi-forge is not designed for
public-internet exposure. See [`SECURITY.md`](./SECURITY.md) for the threat
model and [`docs/deployment.md`](./docs/deployment.md) for deploy guidance.

## License

MIT — see [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE). Built on
[pi-mono](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono), the upstream pi agent SDK.
